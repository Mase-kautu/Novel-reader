        content: "It was a quiet night. The stars sparkled overhead as she walked along the forest path, her breath visible in the cool air like whispered secrets to the trees. Every now and then, an owl called in the distance, its hoot echoing through the stillness."

She liked this path—how it curled through the woods like a ribbon of memory. It was the same one she'd taken as a child, chasing fireflies in the summer, and the same one she'd wandered during restless teenage nights when the world felt too loud. Now, older, with more questions than answers, she found herself here again.

The weight of the day clung to her shoulders, but the night was kind. It asked nothing of her. Just walk. Just breathe.

In her pocket, her fingers brushed the smooth surface of the pendant she'd found earlier in the attic—a small, silver thing shaped like a crescent moon. She didn’t remember seeing it before. It didn’t belong to her, at least not that she knew of. But something about it felt... right. Like it had been waiting.

A soft breeze stirred the branches overhead, and she paused.

There, just ahead, was the clearing.

She hadn’t planned to go there tonight.

But something was calling.
