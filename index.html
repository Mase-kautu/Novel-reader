The stars sparkled overhead as she walked along the forest path, her breath visible in the cool air like whispered secrets to the trees...Each step crunched softly on the frost-hardened leaves beneath her boots. The forest, though dark, held a gentle hush, as if it too was listening—listening to the rhythm of her steps, the subtle rustle of her coat, the murmured thoughts she carried in silence.

A silver fog curled between the trees like smoke from an unseen fire, parting only slightly as she passed through. She paused at a bend in the path, where the moonlight spilled like milk across a clearing. In the center stood the old stone well, half-swallowed by ivy and time.

Her fingers brushed the worn edge as she leaned forward, peering into the black mouth of it. Nothing stirred. But she could feel it—something ancient, familiar, waiting beneath.

The pendant at her neck pulsed warm against her skin.

“It’s almost time,” a voice whispered behind her.

She didn’t flinch. She had known she wasn’t alone.

Turning slowly, she faced the figure emerging from the shadows. Cloaked, hood drawn low, yet something about the stance struck a chord—like a memory she hadn’t known she’d forgotten.

“Then let’s begin,” she said, voice steady.

The wind picked up, scattering pine needles across the ground, and somewhere deep in the woods, something awoke."
